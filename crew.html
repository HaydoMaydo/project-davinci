              <p>
                 I have always been fascinated by the wonder that is space, imagining what it could 
                 be like in the far reaches of our universe. Being a part of Project DaVinci here at
                 STEM means a lot to me as it is a connection to something that has always seemed so far
                 away. Along with star-gazing, I enjoy listening to and playing music on the piano and
                 trumpet. I also enjoy to write. After I've graduated, I plan on attending University of
                 Idaho to study architectural design.
